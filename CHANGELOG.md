# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-24

### Enhanced
Revamped README.md, which now includes project badges (build status, version, license, etc.), clearer project description and usage instructions

A CI pipeline is now running with the first workflows (e.g., install checks, linting, test execution), which are now functioning correctly. A first version of dependency checks has been set in place.

An initial test coverage is introduced, with first set of pytest running successfully

### Fixed

Many `DeprecationWarning` warnings have been resolved (mainly within numpy and matplotlib), making the package more future-proof



## [0.2.3] - 2024-11-15
### Fixed
- Fixed bug when running `set_up=multi-label` with `EnsembleWrapper`
- Updated dependency constraints with `dearpygui`, newest versions are not supported (`lighttheme = create_theme_imgui_light()` raises an error).

### Refactored
- Cleaned some code and dropped unused files and functions (still ongoing)
### Enhanced
- Further streamlined loading of pre-trained models with `EnsembleWrapper` class.
- Improved compatibility between `EnsembleWrapper`and GUI interface



## [0.2.2] - 2024-08-12
### Fixed
- Updated README.md with absolute paths instead of relative ones.
- Updated Python requirements, show explicitly under ```setup.classifiers`` that the package is compatible with any `python >= 3.9`.
### Enhanced
- Improved plotting format in plot_visuals() and inline printing in general, with custom function `frmt_pretty_print`.
- Streamlined storing of trained (Random Forest) models and loading of pre-trained models (Random Forest)

## [0.2.1] - 2024-09-02
### Fixed
- Fixed bug while calling plot_visuals() with `preds_distr = None` and `conf_level != None`, sometimes the wrong axis was being modified.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-09-01
### Refactored
- Refactor the explain() method to accomodate for plot_overview() and plot_visuals(). Separating tasks and making method chaining possible.
- Refactor code to improve performance (e.g. not storing entire test set under `self.X` if not necessary).
### Enhanced
- Improved plotting format in plot_visuals() and inline printing in general, with custom function `frmt_pretty_print`.

## [0.1.4] - 2024-07-28
### Added
- Added regression and multi-label classification datasets to bellatrex.datasets, added feature names to binary dataset.
- Added enhanced visualization output, compatible with single-output predictions.

### Refactored
- Refactored code in the BellatrexExplain class, and gui_plots_code script.
- Refactored code in the visualisation script for compatibiility with BellatrexExplain.

## [0.1.3] - 2024-07-24
### Fixed
- Fixed version file (it was still problematic), made it a .txt file. Updated MANIFEST.in accordingly.

## [0.1.2] - 2024-07-24
### Tested
- Test PyPi released successfully.

## [0.1.1] - 2024-07-24
### Fixed
